                Climate in the mountains becomes colder at high elevations, due to an interaction between radiation and convection.As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase.

                As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase.[10]: 12 

                The effect of the climate on the ecology at an elevation can be largely captured through a combination of amount of precipitation, and the biotemperature, as described by Leslie Holdridge in 1947.[29] Biotemperature is the mean temperature; all temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) are considered to be 0 °C. When the temperature is below 0 °C, plants are dormant, so the exact temperature is unimportant. The peaks of mountains with permanent snow can have a biotemperature below 1.5 °C (34.7 °F).
